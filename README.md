### Hi there 👋, my name is Nick Albu.

I’m making a career transition
from human resources into the
ﬁeld of web development. I've always
liked my career in HR but I never
felt like I truly loved my work. 
Since I've made this swap I can confidently
say I love my new job. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced SCSS & animations. Next I'll be learning Auth/OAuth
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding an entry level development position.
- 💬 Ask me about anything!
